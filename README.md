# ClassQR: An Attendance Verifier to Replace Traditional Attendance Check

## Introduction
Taking the students’ attendance during classes is one of the requirements in a university in monitoring their students’ performance and participation during class lectures. The student attendance can be a great indicator about the student outcomes, expectations, and improves student performance. In a traditional set up, roll calls and saying “present” are the usual procedure in recording the attendance. However, since the pandemic happened, we are now ready to shift back to the traditional face to face classes in the new normal. Along side with this are the changes that happened in the last two years in the school set up such as physical distancing and contactless procedures in conducting a safe face to face classes. 

This study is in line with the fourth SDG namely, giving students a quality education as it ensures that the students are well-monitored as their school year progresses. It is an innovative tool that can serve as a parameter that students are fully attending their classes. 

## Problem Statement
Professors may encounter productivity issues with their classes due to several reasons. One being the most important, time management and efficiency. Time management in conducting classes is considered hard due to the limited time given with so much to cover. This implies every chunk of time given is extremely important in classes.  A significant task being held every class meeting is the attendance roll calls. The minutes covered by the traditional attendance check is considered vital minutes to class meetings. The problem is that attendance check is taking up a significant amount of time to finish when it could be substituted with a more efficient solution.


## Significance
To the students, they will benefit with the higher amount of time given to studying rather than having the extra minutes spent in attendance check. With this change, not only it is a better alternative to traditional roll calls, it also gives them an overview of their attendance on their own rather than just relying on the professor's record.

To the professors, it will be beneficial to them due to the fact that they can allocate more time into their teaching and less time in having these attendance checks which could have been translated into more interactions with the class. With this modern solution, it also gives them the benefit of not doing the sheet work of recording the attendance, given the app has the feature to export attendance CSVs.

## Expected Output

An application that caters an attendance verifier tool that will greatly help the face to face classes. The app produces QR code per class that will be a requirement for the students to scan in order to verify their class attendance. It also creates a monthly report of your attendance in each class. This makes it easier for the students and as well as the facilitator of the class instead of having roll calls each class. They could just scan the QR code before or after the class.

Verifying students’ attendance through QR codes are much easier and flexible in the current situation of the limited face to face classes. This alleviates the contact between the students rather than the traditional checking of attendance through pen and paper that roams around the classroom. Aside from this, it also helps instructors in a way that it lessens the time consumed for the attendance every class and manages their time wisely in teaching the lectures. With the technology in the modern age, this system can help faculty and staff to easily monitor and record the attendance of their students every class.
